# PayFlix – Instant Streaming Commerce on Solana

Creators deserve instant, transparent payouts. Viewers deserve seamless access. PayFlix delivers both with GPU-smooth streaming, Digital ID verification, and MCP-ready APIs that plug into AI agents (Daydreams) out of the box.

## Highlights
- **Live Digital ID** – every purchase shows “Verified X seconds ago.”
- **X‑402 Session Keys** – frictionless pay-per-view with USDC.
- **MCP Tool Provider** – agents call PayFlix via Model Context Protocol.
- **Daydreams Facilitator Support** – scoped keys + spend caps for partners.
- **Token-Ready Roadmap** – facilitator marketplace, AI-native uploads, credit lines.

## Why PayFlix
Streaming platforms hide payouts and take weeks to settle. PayFlix proves every transaction instantly. We built a creator-first console, Digital ID badges, and public docs so partners can verify the rails themselves.

## Features
- **Digital ID Badges:** lifetime + 24h stats, recent payouts, on-chain links.
- **X‑402 Seamless Payments:** viewers deposit once, unlock everything without pop-ups.
- **MCP Commands:** fetch stats, list videos, check session balances, trigger unlocks.
- **Facilitator Proxy:** scoped keys + spend caps for Daydreams/partners.
- **Creator Console:** translucent “mission control” with history drawer, graph, modules.
