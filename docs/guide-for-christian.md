# Guide for Christian

A single page you can send to recruiters, founders, or platforms (Upwork, Fiverr, LinkedIn) so they immediately understand what you deliver and how to engage.

## Positioning

- **Role**: Full-stack AI/MCP engineer owning frontend (React/Next), backend (Express/Supabase/Postgres), deterministic data pipelines, and LLM orchestration.
- **Signature systems**: PayFlix (X402 streaming commerce), SeekerXAI (Grok-backed research console), Dreams/DAG integrations, MCP endpoint design, partner onboarding playbooks.
- **Value prop**: You provide both architecture and execution—MCP wiring, deterministic DAGs, prompt tuning, UI polish, documentation, and partner enablement in 7–10 day build cycles.

## Portfolio Highlights

| Project | What it proves | Links |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PayFlix** | End-to-end streaming marketplace with X402 payments, session keys, Digital IDs, and MCP/Dreams tooling. | `https://staging.payflix.fun` |
| **SeekerXAI** | Deterministic Grok pipeline, hashed DAG feeds, multi-agent research tooling, and MCP surfaces. | `https://seekerxai.com` |
| **Suggested Offer API (NoOnes)** | Full 3-phase roadmap (JSON schema, facilitator endpoints, partner UX) delivered in 7 days. | See `docs/overview/platform.md` Appendix I + `docs/briefings/` |

## Compensation Benchmarks

- **Full-time / long contract**: $180K–$250K+ USD total comp (US/EU markets) or $120–$200/hr.
- **Rapid prototypes**: $12K fixed for a 7-day MCP/DAG prototype (includes architecture doc + hand-off call).

## Platform Strategy (Upwork/Fiverr)

1. **Profile tagline** – “Full-stack AI/MCP engineer – built PayFlix & SeekerXAI (X402 session keys, Grok DAGs, Dreams agents).”
2. **Proof** – Upload PayFlix/SeekerXAI screenshots + a short Loom walkthrough.
3. **Starter gig** – “Prototype your MCP + dashboard in 7 days (includes data ingestion, JSON schema, UI demo).”
4. **First reviews** – Take 1–2 scoped gigs at $100–$120/hr to gather 5★ feedback, then raise rates.
5. **Proposals** – Reference their problem directly (“wire your internal API into MCP commands like PayFlix’s `payflix.unlockVideo`”).
6. **Risk reducer** – Offer paid discovery (Phase 1 doc + roadmap) before larger milestones.

## Outreach Checklist

- Keep GitHub repos private but showcase the README narrative; grant access on request.
- Mention NoOnes/Paxful relationship and X402 hackathon participation in intros.
- Always include live demos + doc system links (`README.md`, `docs/overview/platform.md`, `docs/mcp-partner-pack.md`).
- When sending the engagement PDF, pair it with a Calendly link for a 30‑minute scoping call.

## Next Steps Pipeline

1. Finish distributing the `Christian_Torres_Engagement_Briefing.pdf` to warm leads.
2. Spin up tailored MCP agent prompts for each prospect (append to `docs/daydreams-agent-contexts.md`).
3. Capture testimonials from existing partners (Ray/NoOnes, hackathon judges) and paste excerpts here.
4. Keep `README.md` + `docs/overview/platform.md` synced after every major build.

Use this as your copy/paste kit or adapt it per audience. Update quarterly so it reflects your latest work.
